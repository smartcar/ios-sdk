The SmartcarAuth iOS SDK makes it easy to integrate with Smartcar Connect from iOS.

The SDK follows the best practices set out in [OAuth 2.0 for Native Apps](https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-oauth-native-apps-06) including using _SFSafariViewController_ on iOS for the authorization request. _UIWebView_ is explicitly not supported due to usability and security reasons.

## Requirements

SmartcarAuth supports iOS 7 and above.

iOS 9+ uses the in-app browser tab pattern (via _SFSafariViewController_), and falls back to the system browser (mobile Safari) on earlier versions.

## Installation

SmartcarAuth is available through [CocoaPods](http://cocoapods.org). To install it, simply add the following line to your Podfile:

```
pod "SmartcarAuth"
```

## Getting Started

First, you need to have a global SmartcarAuth object in your AppDelegate to hold the session, in order to continue the authorization flow from the redirect.

```swift
// global variable in the app's AppDelegate
var smartcarSdk: SmartcarAuth? = nil
```

Then, initiate the SmartcarAuth object in the UIViewController.

```swift
let appDelegate = UIApplication.shared.delegate as! AppDelegate

func completionHandler(err: Error?, code: String?, state: String?) -> Any {
 // Receive authorization code
}

appDelegate.smartcar = SmartcarAuth(
  clientId: "afb0b7d3-807f-4c61-9b04-352e91fe3134",
  redirectUri: "scafb0b7d3-807f-4c61-9b04-352e91fe3134://page",
  scope: ["read_vin", "read_vehicle_info", "read_odometer"],
  completion: completionHandler
)
let smartcar = appDelegate.smartcar

// Launch Connect on the SFSafariViewController
smartcar.launchAuthFlow(state: state, forcePrompt: false, testMode: false, viewController: viewController)
```

## Handling the Redirect

The Connect response is returned to the app via the iOS openURL app delegate method, so you need to pipe this through to the current authorization session

```swift
/**
	Intercepts callback from OAuth SafariView determined by the custom URI
 */
func application(_ application: UIApplication, open url: URL, options: [UIApplicationOpenURLOptionsLey : Any] = [:]) -> Bool {
    // Close the SFSafariViewController
    window!.rootViewController?.presentedViewController?.dismiss(animated: true , completion: nil)

    // Sends the URL to the current SmartcarAuth object (if any) which will
    // process it and then call the completion handler.
    if let sdk = smartcarSdk {
        sdk.handleCallback(url: url)
    }

    // Your additional URL handling (if any) goes here.

    return true
}
```
